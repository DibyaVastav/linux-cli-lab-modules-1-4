1. echo - creates the file and writes a message into it.
2. ln sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt - The ln command was used to create a hard link to sample_data.txt.
On Windows-based Git Bash, hard link creation is restricted due to filesystem permission limitations, so the operation was denied.
ln -s sample_data.txt sample_soft.txt - This command creates a symbolic (soft) link that points to the original file.
3. ls -li sample_data.txt sample_soft.txt - In a Linux filesystem, hard links share the same inode as the original file.
Due to Windows filesystem limitations in Git Bash, hard link creation was not permitted, so inode sharing could not be demonstrated.
The symbolic link has a different inode because it only stores the path to the original file.
4. stat sample_data.txt - file metadata inspection
5. du -sh ~ - disk usage check, displays the total disk usage of the current directory in a human-readable format.
7. ls -lh
rm sample_soft.txt
cat sample_data.txt
df -h
